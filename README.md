# Sampling Bias in the Fossil Record
A workshop developed for Progressive Palaeontology 2020.

# Authors
Bethany Allen, Alex Dunhill and Graeme Lloyd

Palaeo@Leeds, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, UK

# Getting started
This workshop is comprised of videos and practicals in R, a statistical programming language. In order to run the practicals, you will need to download and install R onto your computer. You may also want to install RStudio, a wrapper for R which organises your inputs and outputs into easy-to-see panels.

Download R by choosing your local CRAN mirror here: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

Download RStudio here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

We will only cover enough basic R here to allow new users to complete the practicals. If you want to learn more about R, we recommend the textbook "Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists" by Andrew Beckerman, Dylan Childs and Owen Petchley.

To access the workshop files, click the green "Clone or download" button at the top right of this page, and select "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, open the folder by right-clicking and selecting "Extract all", saving the files somewhere you can access them.

If you have your own GitHub account, you may want to keep your own copy of this repository by 'forking' it, again via the relevant button at the top right of this page.

# Accessing the videos
There are two video lectures associated with the workshop. We advise that you watch the videos first, as these will introduce you to the key concepts.

The first is an introduction to the sources of sampling bias in the fossil record, given by Dr. Alex Dunhill, and can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smfm6mR-obE (duration: 45 mins)

The second is a discussion of what sampling bias means for palaeontologists who want to conduct quantitative analysis of the fossil record, given by Dr. Graeme Lloyd, and can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKK4dERKqFU (duration: 55 mins)

# Running the practicals
To run the practicals, start R (or RStudio, if you have installed it). Using 'Open' at the top left of either program, open the script you want to run; they are numbered in their recommended order.

All of our scripts have been written to download data directly from the Paleobiology Database, so you shouldn't need to worry too much about where you've saved your files. However, if you do wish to use saved data, you will need to tell R where to find the files by setting the working directory. This is briefly covered in Script 1.

Start running the script line-by-line in the console. A # indicates a comment - that's for you to read, not the computer. We have tried to be extensive in our explanations of what is happening in the code to help you understand the processes.

Raup 1972 (www.jstor.org/stable/1734207): One of the most famous papers in macroevolution, this is the first attempt at producing a diversity curve for the whole Phanerozoic. This paper is where a lot of core ideas relating to models and subsampling were laid out.

Colwell & Coddington 1994 (https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1994.0091): A review paper discussing the theory of collector curves and how they relate to extrapolation metrics for estimating diversity. Written from an ecology perspective, but also holds for analysis of the fossil record.

Peters 2005 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0502616102): This paper outlines the 'common cause' hypothesis, discussing how environmental drivers can influence both biodiversity and sampling biases to shape our perception of diversity in deep time.
